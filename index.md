<img align = "left" src="adamandersson.jpg" width="150">

I am Adjunct Associate Professor in computational mathematics at the Department of Mathematical Sciences at Chalmers University of Technology and Senior Radar Systems Engineer at Saab. 

## Research

**Deep learning accelerated computations:** This is my main research field. It concerns the use of deep learning to obtain computationally feasible approximate algorithms for problems that are . I work in non-linear filtering, optimal control, Bayesian statistics 

**Radar signal and data processing:** Still learng this

**Stochastic analysis:** 

## Supervision

### PhD students

- **Kasper Bågmark** is working on deep learning for the nonlinear filtering problem. It is an academic project financed by the Wallenberg AI, Autonomous Systems and Software Program. Kasper belongs to the mathematics for AI research school. He started in August 2020.

### Master students

- **Axel Nathanson** is working on applying reinforcement learning for the radar resource management problem, i.e., the optimization problem of how to use the radar energy in the best way in order to both detect new unknown targets and to track allready known targets.
