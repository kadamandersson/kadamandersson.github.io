I am Adjunct Associate Professor in Computational Mathematics at the Department of Mathematical Sciences at Chalmers University of Technology and Senior Radar Systems Engineer at Saab. 

My current research topic conserns the use of deep learning to obtain accelerated and scalable algorithms for computationally challenging problems. More precisely, I work on deep learning for non-linear filtering, optimal control, Bayesian statistics, scientific computations, radar signal processing and control. 

In my previous research I worked on stochastic differential equations, in particular numerical analysis, solution theory and Malliavin calculus for stochastic partial differential equations. When I define new research topics I try to find synnergies with my old research field.

## Supervision

I am continuously supervising students at both master and PhD level. If you are a student who share some of my interests, please do not hessitate to reach out to me. Topics of enough relevance for Saab can be made into an industrial master thesis och PhD projects with the benefits of working in a professionally and socially interesting context. Otherwise, I plan to occationally supervise academic master thesis projects. Examples of topics that interest me are:

- Deep learning accelerated numerical schemes for Maxwell's equations.
- Reinforcement learning for optimal radar resource management. 
- Bayesian statistics for clutter suppresion in radar signal processing. 
- Neural networks with functional input.
- Signature based machine learning, see for instance [this paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.08494).

### PhD students

- **Kasper Bågmark** is working on deep learning for the nonlinear filtering problem. The aim is to obtain approximate filters that scale much better than particle filters. It is an academic project financed by the Wallenberg AI, Autonomous Systems and Software Program. Kasper belongs to the mathematics for AI research school. He started in August 2020.

### Master thesis students

- **Axel Nathanson** is working on applying reinforcement learning for the radar resource management problem, i.e., the problem of controlling the radar energy optimally in order to both detect new unknown targets and to track allready known targets. Axel is enrolled in the Engineering Mathematics and Computational Science master program at Chalmers. He is a contracted master thesis student at Saab and started in January 2021.
