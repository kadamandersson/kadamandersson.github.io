I am Adjunct Associate Professor in Computational Mathematics at the [Department of Mathematical Sciences](https://www.chalmers.se/sv/institutioner/math/Sidor/default.aspx) at [Chalmers University of Technology](https://www.chalmers.se/sv/Sidor/default.aspx) and [University of Gothenburg](https://www.gu.se) and Specialist in Engineering Mathematics at [Saab](https://www.saab.com). 

My current academic research concerns deep learning accelerated computational methods for nonlinear filtering, control and partially observabe Markov games. The goal is to push the boundaries for what can be filtered, controlled and played in real time. 

In my previous research I worked on stochastic differential equations, in particular numerical analysis, solution theory and Malliavin calculus for stochastic partial differential equations. 

In my specialist role at Saab I lead the development within the field of engineering mathematics in specific directions that I define. This consists in particular of investigating collaborations and funding oportunities for research studies or projects.
