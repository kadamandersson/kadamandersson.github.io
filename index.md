I am Adjunct Associate Professor in Computational Mathematics at the [Department of Mathematical Sciences](https://www.chalmers.se/sv/institutioner/math/Sidor/default.aspx) at [Chalmers University of Technology](https://www.chalmers.se/sv/Sidor/default.aspx) and [University of Gothenburg](https://www.gu.se), and Senior Radar Systems Engineer at [Saab](https://www.saab.com). 

My current research topic conserns the use of deep learning to obtain accelerated and scalable algorithms for computationally challenging problems. More precisely, I work on deep learning for non-linear filtering, optimal control, Bayesian statistics, solving PDE and radar signal processing. 

In my previous research I worked on stochastic differential equations, in particular numerical analysis, solution theory and Malliavin calculus for stochastic partial differential equations. When I define new research topics I try to find synergies with my old research field.

## Supervision

I am continuously supervising students at both master and PhD level. If you are a student who share some of my interests, please do not hessitate to reach out to me. Topics of enough relevance for Saab can be made into an industrial master thesis or eventually industrial PhD projects with the benefit of working in a professionally and socially interesting context. Otherwise, I plan to occasionally supervise academic master thesis projects. Thesis topics that interest me are:

- Deep learning accelerated numerical schemes for Maxwell's equations.
- Deep learning accelerated Bayesian methods. See for instance this [master thesis](https://odr.chalmers.se/bitstream/20.500.12380/301661/1/Master_s_Thesis_Elias_Oskar_.pdf).
- Deep learning accelerated optimal control inside a domain. Extension of this [master thesis](https://odr.chalmers.se/bitstream/20.500.12380/256458/1/256458.pdf).
- Reinforcement learning for optimal radar resource management. 
- Bayesian methods for radar signal processing. 
- Investigation of the chirplet transform for radar signal processing.
- Signature based machine learning. See for instance this [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.08494) or this [master thesis](https://odr.chalmers.se/bitstream/20.500.12380/251852/1/251852.pdf).
- Neural networks with functional input. 
- Theory for a continuous time formulation of the multi object target tracking problem. A challenging project within stochastic analysis and Bayesian statistics.

### PhD students

- **Kasper Bågmark** is working on deep learning for the nonlinear filtering problem. The aim is to obtain approximate filters that scale much better than particle filters. It is an academic project financed by the Wallenberg AI, Autonomous Systems and Software Program. Kasper belongs to the mathematics for AI research school. He started in August 2020.

### Master thesis students

- **Axel Nathanson** is working on applying reinforcement learning for the radar resource management problem, i.e., the problem of controlling the radar energy optimally in order to both detect new unknown targets and to track allready known targets. Axel is enrolled in the Engineering Mathematics and Computational Science master program at Chalmers. He is a contracted master thesis student at Saab and started in January 2021.
